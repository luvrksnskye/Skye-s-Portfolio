# My portfolio!

I wanted to make a little portfolio as an exercise for myself, so that's what I did! I wanted to make it in a retro style, maybe like a video game, and all I could think of were the Nintendo games I used to play on my 3DS when I was a kid. I used some assets from NSO (Needy Streamer Overload) to achieve this, but not much else besides some tweaking of the colors. I don't really intend for this to look so professional and empty! But I wanted to do my best to make something cute for myself. I plan on updating it soon to be phone-friendly, so I'll be working on that over the next few days and seeing what else I can add.
